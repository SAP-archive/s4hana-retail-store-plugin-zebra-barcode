# SAP S/4HANA Retail Store Plugin for Zebra Barcodescanner integration

This repository contains a sample implementation of a Cordova Plugin to enable the on-device laser scanner as an input device for the [In-Store Merchandise and Inventory Management Fiori Apps](https://help.sap.com/viewer/9905622a5c1f49ba84e9076fc83a9c2c/latest/en-US/4018b657ace85b3be10000000a4450e5.html).

## Description

This sample code can be used to integrate the bar code scanner of a Zebra TC75x as an input device for the **In-Store Merchandise and Inventory Management Fiori Apps** when used as a plugin for the **Custom SAP Fiori Client**.

### Bar Code Scanner

Store associates use bar code scanners to scan the global trade item numbers (GTIN) of products that are tagged with bar codes. This enables store associates to manually identify products in a store, for example, to order the scanned products.

## Requirements

- At least Android 7.x running on your Zebra device
- A Zebra TC75x Mobile Device
- An SAP S/4 HANA with the **In-Store Merchandise and Inventory Management Fiori Apps** up and running

### Third-Party Dependencies

In addition to the sample code provided here, the **Zebra Enterprise Mobility Development Kit (EMDK)** is required and will be automatically downloaded during the build process of your Custom SAP Fiori Client. Visit the [Product Information from Zebra](https://www.zebra.com/us/en/products/software/mobile-computers/mobile-app-utilities/emdk-for-android.html) (Link to external website) for further information about it.
